            <h3>Visiting</h3>
            <p>The Oak Ridge National Laboratory campus is located in a secured area with gaurded, restricted access. Before visiting ORNL, your trip must be prearranged for you to access the lab.</p>
            <p>Once your visit is arranged, you will enter the lab from the East or West gate. (It is best to have your own car. Taxis and rideshares will not be allowed through the gate.) These gates are on either end of Bethel Valley Road, which passes through the whole laboratory. At your arrival, you will first have to report to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oak+Ridge+National+Laboratory+Visitor+Center/@35.9311209,-84.3100116,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x885dd2f51139699f:0x6d1701c6641b0619!8m2!3d35.9311209!4d-84.3100116!16s/g/1232zvscp?entry=ttu">ORNL badge office</a>, which is near the roundabout on Bethel Valley Road. Although there is a small parking lot near the badge office, I recommend parking in the larger lot to the North (uphill) of the roundabout and then walk down, across Bethel Valley Road to the South to the first building on your left. If I have not met you there, my office is nearby in building 5700, room G207.</p>
            <p>More information about visiting and maps are available at the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/content/come-see-us">ORNL contact pages</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="images/cerl-front-door.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/cerl-front-door.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="241" class="profilePicContact"/></a>Sandia is a big place, and going to our mail distribution center won't help you find me. My office is in the Cyber Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL). CERL is conveniently located outside of Kirtland Air Force Base. This makes visiting easier, but remember that <em>you still need to prearrange your visit</em> to get appropriately badged. Please do not arrive without making arrangements first. Also <em>do not send mail directly to this building</em>.</p>
            <p>CERL is located at <em>10700 Research Road</em>, which is at the intersection of Research Road and Innovation Parkway. The parking lot and front door are located opposite the road. The most straightforward way to get to the building is to take Research Road straight from Eubank. Most visitors get a badge from the badge office first. The badge office is located in the IPOC building at 1611 Innovation Parkway SE. Many people find it more convenient to take Innovation Parkway, which comes from Eubank to the North and then loops around CERL and IPOC back to Eubank at the South. Both locations are shown on the map below.</p>

            <p>My office is CERL/157. Most people find the CERL layout quite labyrinthine. To find my way around, I find it helpful to think of CERL as divided into West and East wings. Each wing has  a loop that you can follow where the room numbers increase in the clockwise direction. To get to my office, head right from reception (to the East wing), then turn left and follow clockwise to the right until you reach room 157 at the north side of the building.</p>
